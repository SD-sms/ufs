    This test is to ensure that the workflow completes successfully with
    QUILTING disabled.  The forecast runs on the RRFS_CONUScompact_25km
    grid using the RAP physics suite with ICs derived from the FV3GFS and
    LBCs derived from the RAP.  Note that with QUILTING disabled, the run_post
    and subsequent tasks in the SRW App workflow cannot be run.  This is
    because QUILTING disabled, the output from the UFS Weather Model is on
    the Weather Model's native grid, not the write-component grid, and UPP
    does not (yet) have the capability to process output on the native grid.
