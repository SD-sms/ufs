    This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode
    completes successfully with MET deterministic verification but with
    other tasks (e.g. forecast) deactivated.

# NET and POST_OUTPUT_DOMAIN_NAME are needed to construct the paths/names
# of the staged forecast files if those files use the default directory
# and file naming convention assumed in the SRW App (which is the case
# for this test).  They are also needed to construct the default value
# of VX_FCST_MODEL_NAME if an explicit value for it has not been specified
# (which is also the case for this test).  (VX_FCST_MODEL_NAME is the
# (base) forecast model name to use in the vx output, both in the output
# file names and in their contents.)  The alternative is to specify
# VX_FCST_MODEL_NAME, in which case POST_OUTPUT_DOMAIN_NAME is not needed.
