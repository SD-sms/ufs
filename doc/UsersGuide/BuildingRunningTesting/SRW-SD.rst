SRW Smoke & Dust (SRW-SD) Features
=====================================

.. attention::

   SRW-SD capabilities are a new SRW App feature supported only on Hera; on other systems, users can expect only limited support. 

This chapter provides instructions for running a sample six-hour forecast for July, 22, 2019 at 0z using SRW Smoke & Dust (SRW-SD) features. These features have been merged into the SRW App repository from the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS) repository. This forecast uses RAP data for :term:`ICs` and :term:`LBCs`, the ``RRFS_CONUS_3km`` predefined grid, and the ``FV3_HRRR_gf`` physics suite. This pysics suite is similar to the NOAA operational HRRR v4 suite (Dowell et al., 2022), with the addition of the Grell-Freitas deep convective parameterization. `Scientific documentation for the HRRR_gf suite <https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/GMTB/v7.0.0/sci_doc/_h_r_r_r_gf_page.html>`_ and `technical documentation <https://ccpp-techdoc.readthedocs.io/en/v7.0.0/>`_ are available with the CCPP v7.0.0 release but may differ slightly from the version available in the SRW App. 

.. note::

   Although this chapter is the primary documentation resource for running the SRW-SD configuration, users may need to refer to :numref:`Chapter %s <BuildSRW>` and :numref:`Chapter %s <RunSRW>` for additional information on building and running the SRW App, respectively. 

Quick Start Guide (SRW-SD)
=============================

.. attention::

   These instructions should work smoothly on Hera, but users on other systems may need to make additional adjustments. 

Download the Code
-------------------

Clone the |branch| branch of the authoritative SRW App repository:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone -b smoke_dust https://github.com/chan-hoo/ufs-srweather-app
   cd ufs-srweather-app

.. COMMENT: Update clone command to reflect authoritative branch once features are merged in. 

Checkout Externals
---------------------

Users must run the ``checkout_externals`` script to collect (or "check out") the individual components of the SRW App (AQM version) from their respective GitHub repositories. 

.. code-block:: console

   ./manage_externals/checkout_externals -e Externals_smoke_dust.cfg

Build the SRW App with AQM
-----------------------------

On Hera, users can build the SRW App AQM binaries with the smoke argument:

.. code-block:: console

   ./devbuild.sh -p=<machine> --smoke

where ``<machine>`` is ``hera``. The ``--smoke`` argument indicates the configuration/version of the application to build (i.e., SRW-SD). 

Building the SRW App with SRW-SD on other machines, including other :srw-wiki:`Level 1 <Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>` platforms, is not currently guaranteed to work, and users may have to make adjustments to the modulefiles for their system. 

If SRW-SD builds correctly, users should see the standard executables listed in :numref:`Table %s <ExecDescription>` in the ``ufs-srweather-app/exec`` directory.

Load the |wflow_env| Environment
--------------------------------------------

Load the Python environment for the workflow:

.. code-block:: console

   module use /path/to/ufs-srweather-app/modulefiles
   module load wflow_<machine>
   conda activate srw_app

where ``<machine>`` is ``hera``. The workflow should load on other platforms listed under the ``MACHINE`` variable in :numref:`Section %s <user>`, but users may need to adjust other elements of the process when running on those platforms. 

.. _srw-sd-config:

Configure an Experiment
---------------------------

Users will need to configure their experiment by setting parameters in the ``config.yaml`` file. To start, users can copy a default experiment setting into ``config.yaml``:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ush
   cp config.smoke_dust.yaml config.yaml
   
Users will need to change the ``ACCOUNT`` variable in ``config.yaml`` to an account they have access to. They may also wish to adjust other experiment settings. For more information on each task and variable, see :numref:`Section %s <ConfigWorkflow>`. 

On Level 1 systems, users can find :term:`ICs/LBCs` for the SRW-SD sample case in the usual :ref:`input data locations <Data>` under ``RAP/2019072200``. Users will need to add the following lines to ``task_get_extrn_*:`` in their ``config.yaml`` file, adjusting the file path to point to the correct data locations:

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_ics:
     USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS: /scratch1/NCEPDEV/nems/role.epic/UFS_SRW_data/develop/input_model_data/RAP/${yyyymmddhh}
   task_get_extrn_lbcs:
     USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS: /scratch1/NCEPDEV/nems/role.epic/UFS_SRW_data/develop/input_model_data/RAP/${yyyymmddhh}

Note that users on other systems will need to use the correct data path for their system. Currently, Hera is the only system supported, but the data is available on other Level 1 systems for those interested in tinkering with the workflow. 

.. COMMENT: Data not in bucket yet. Path needs changing. 
   Users can also download the data required for the community experiment from the `UFS SRW App Data Bucket <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#develop-20240618/input_model_data/FV3GFS/netcdf/>`_. 

Users may also wish to change :term:`cron`-related parameters in ``config.yaml``. In the ``config.smoke_dust.yaml`` file, which was copied into ``config.yaml``, cron is used for automatic submission and resubmission of the workflow:

.. code-block:: console

   workflow:
     USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH: true
     CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS: 3

This means that cron will submit the launch script every 3 minutes. Users may choose not to submit using cron or to submit at a different frequency. Note that users should create a crontab by running ``crontab -e`` the first time they use cron.

When using the basic ``config.smoke_dust.yaml`` experiment, the usual pre-processing and colstart forecast tasks are used,  because ``"parm/wflow/prep.yaml"`` appears in the list of workflow files in the ``rocoto: tasks: taskgroups:`` section of ``config.yaml`` (see :numref:`Section %s <TasksPrepAQM>` for task descriptions). To turn on AQM *post*-processing tasks in the workflow, include ``"parm/wflow/aqm_post.yaml"`` in the ``rocoto: tasks: taskgroups:`` section, too (see :numref:`Section %s <TasksPostAQM>` for task descriptions). 

.. COMMENT: Update wflow info above! 


.. _srw-sd-more-tasks:

Additional SRW-SD Tasks
--------------------------

.. COMMENT:
   :numref:`Figure %s <FlowProcAQM>` illustrates the full non-:term:`DA <data assimilation>` SRW-SD workflow using a flowchart. 

Compared to the typical SRW App workflow, the SRW-SD has slightly different tasks for pre- and post-processing. As in the SRW App default workflow, the SRW-SD workflow uses the preprocessing tasks from ``prep.yaml``, but it adds smoke-and-dust-specific tasks from ``smoke_dust.yaml``. For post-processing, it uses the NCO-compliant ``upp_post.yaml`` instead of the usual ``post.yaml``.

      *Workflow Structure of SRW-SD*


The new tasks for SRW-SD are shown in :numref:`Table %s <pre-srw-sd>`. 

.. _pre-srw-sd:

.. list-table:: *Tasks for SRW-SD Pre- and Post-Processing*
   :widths: 20 50 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Task Name
     - Description
     - File
   * - smoke_dust
     - Generates the input data file for smoke and dust to be used in the UFS Weather Model.
     - ``parm/wflow/smoke_dust.yaml``
   * - prepstart
     - Adds the smoke and dust fields to the ICs file from the restart file in the previous cycle.
     - ``parm/wflow/smoke_dust.yaml``
   * - upp_post
     - Performs post-processing with UPP.
     - ``parm/wflow/upp_post.yaml``


.. COMMENT: Add info about Python scripts
   Python scripts:
      * ush/generate_fire_emissions.py
      * ush/HWP_tools.py
      * ush/interp_tools.py
      * ush/add_smoke.py


Generate the Workflow
------------------------

Generate the workflow:

.. code-block:: console

   ./generate_FV3LAM_wflow.py

Run the Workflow
------------------

If ``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH`` is set to true in ``config.yaml`` (see :numref:`Section %s <srw-sd-config>`), the workflow will run automatically. If it was set to false, users must submit the workflow manually from the experiment directory:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ../../expt_dirs/smoke_dust_conus3km
   ./launch_FV3LAM_wflow.sh

Repeat the launch command regularly until a SUCCESS or FAILURE message appears on the terminal window. 

Users may check experiment status from the experiment directory with either of the following commands: 

.. code-block:: console

   # Check the experiment status (for cron jobs)
   rocotostat -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10

   # Check the experiment status and relaunch the workflow (for manual jobs)
   ./launch_FV3LAM_wflow.sh; tail -n 40 log.launch_FV3LAM_wflow

To see a description of each of the AQM workflow tasks, see :numref:`Section %s <AQM-more-tasks>`.

.. _srw-sd-success:

Experiment Output
--------------------

The workflow run is complete when all tasks display a "SUCCEEDED" message. If everything goes smoothly, users will eventually see a workflow status table similar to the following: 

.. code-block:: console
