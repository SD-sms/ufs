# UFS Short-Range Weather Application

The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. It is designed to be the source system for NOAAâ€™s operational numerical weather prediction applications while enabling research, development, and contribution opportunities for the broader Weather Enterprise. For more information about the UFS, visit the UFS Portal at https://ufscommunity.org/.

The UFS includes multiple applications (see a complete list at https://ufscommunity.org/science/aboutapps/) that support different forecast durations and spatial domains. This documentation describes the v2.1.0 release branch of the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application, which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from minutes to several days. The development branch of the application is continually evolving as the system undergoes open development. The latest SRW App release (v2.1.0) represents a snapshot of this continuously evolving system. 

For instructions on how to clone the repository, build the code, and run the workflow, view the instructions in the SRW App User's Guide. The UFS SRW App User's Guide specific to the SRW App v2.1.0 release can be found at: https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/release-public-v2.1.0/, while the documentation for the development branch is at: https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/develop/. The repository is at: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app.
