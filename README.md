# UFS Short-Range Weather Application

The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. It is designed to be the source system for NOAAâ€™s operational numerical weather prediction applications while enabling research, development, and contribution opportunities for the broader weather enterprise. For more information about the UFS, visit the UFS Portal at https://ufscommunity.org/.

The UFS can be configured for multiple applications (see a complete list at https://ufscommunity.org/#/science/aboutapps). The configuration described here is the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application, which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from less than an hour out to several days. The SRW App v1.0.0 represents a snapshot of a continuously evolving system undergoing open development and includes a prognostic atmospheric model, pre- and post-processing, and a community workflow for running the system end-to-end. The UFS SRW App User's Guide is at: https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v1.0.0. The repository is at: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app.
