# Prior to building, you must set up the environment so cmake can find the appropriate
# compilers and libraries. For instructions specific to supported platforms, see the
# included "README" files in this directory. The README files give instructions assuming
# a bash or ksh login shell, for csh and tcsh users you will have to modify the commands
# for setting envronment variables.
