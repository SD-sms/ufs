.. _ConfigWorkflow:

==================================================================
Configuring the Workflow: ``config.sh`` and ``config_defaults.sh``		
==================================================================
To create the experiment directory and workflow when running the SRW App, the user must create an experiment configuration file named ``config.sh``. This file contains experiment-specific information, such as dates, external model data, directories, and other relevant settings. To help the user, two sample configuration files have been included in the ``regional_workflow`` repositoryâ€™s ``ush`` directory: ``config.community.sh`` and ``config.nco.sh``. The first is for running experiments in community mode (``RUN_ENVIR`` set to "community"; see below), and the second is for running experiments in "nco" mode (``RUN_ENVIR`` set to "nco"). Note that for this release, only "community" mode is supported. These files can be used as the starting point from which to generate a variety of experiment configurations in which to run the SRW App.

..
   COMMENT: Is community mode still the only one supported? 

There is an extensive list of experiment parameters that a user can set when configuring the experiment. Not all of these need to be explicitly set by the user in ``config.sh``. If a user does not define an entry in the ``config.sh`` script, either its value in ``config_defaults.sh`` will be used, or it will be reset depending on other parameters, such as the platform on which the experiment will be run (specified by ``MACHINE``). Note that ``config_defaults.sh`` contains the full list of experiment parameters that a user may set in ``config.sh`` (i.e., the user cannot set parameters in config.sh that are not initialized in ``config_defaults.sh``).

The following is a list of the parameters in the ``config_defaults.sh`` file. For each parameter, the default value and a brief description is given. In addition, any relevant information on features and settings supported or unsupported in this release is specified.

Platform Environment
====================
``RUN_ENVIR``: (Default: "nco")
   This variable determines the mode that the workflow will run in. The user can choose between two modes: "nco" and "community." The "nco" mode uses a directory structure that mimics what is used in operations at NOAA/NCEP Central Operations (NCO) and at the NOAA/NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), which is working with NCO on pre-implementation testing. Specifics of the conventions used in "nco" mode can be found in the following `WCOSS Implementation Standards <https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/idsb/implementation_standards/>`__ document:

   | NCEP Central Operations
   | WCOSS Implementation Standards
   | January 19, 2022
   | Version 11.0.0
   
   Setting ``RUN_ENVIR`` to "community" will use the standard directory structure and variable naming convention and is recommended in most cases for users who are not planning to implement their code into operations at NCO.

``MACHINE``: (Default: "BIG_COMPUTER")
   The machine (a.k.a. platform) on which the workflow will run. Currently supported platforms include "WCOSS_DELL_P3," "HERA," "ORION," "JET," "ODIN," "CHEYENNE," "STAMPEDE," "GAEA," "SINGULARITY," "NOAACLOUD," "MACOS," and "LINUX." When running the SRW App in a container, set ``MACHINE`` to "SINGULARITY" regardless of the underlying platform. 
..
   COMMENT: Are we deleting WCOSS_CRAY and/or GAEA? Any others to add besides SINGULARITY/NOAACLOUD? 

``ACCOUNT``: (Default: "project_name")
   The account under which to submit jobs to the queue on the specified ``MACHINE``. To determine an appropriate ACCOUNT field for Level 1 systems, users may run ``groups``, which will return a list of projects the user has permissions for. Not all of the listed projects/groups have an HPC allocation, but those that do are potentially valid account names. The ``account_params`` command will display additional account details. 

``WORKFLOW_MANAGER``: (Default: "none")
   The workflow manager to use (e.g. "ROCOTO"). This is set to "none" by default, but if the machine name is set to a platform that supports Rocoto, this will be overwritten and set to "ROCOTO." Valid values: "rocoto" "none"

``SCHED``: (Default: "")
   The job scheduler to use (e.g., Slurm) on the specified ``MACHINE``. Set this to an empty string in order for the experiment generation script to set it automatically depending on the machine the workflow is running on. Valid values: "slurm" "pbspro" "lsf" "lsfcray" "none"

Machine-Dependent Parameters:
-------------------------------
These parameters vary depending on machine. On `Level 1 and 2 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ systems, the appropriate values for each machine can be viewed in the ``regional_workflow/ush/machine/<platform>.sh`` scripts. To specify a value other than the default, add these variables and the desired value in the ``config.sh`` file so that they override the ``config_defaults.sh`` and machine default values. 

``PARTITION_DEFAULT``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). This is the default partition to which Slurm submits workflow tasks. When a variable that specifies the partition (e.g., ``PARTITION_HPSS``, ``PARTITION_FCST``; see below) is **not** specified, the task will be submitted to the default partition indicated in the ``PARTITION_DEFAULT`` variable. If this value is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "hera" "normal" "orion" "sjet,vjet,kjet,xjet" "workq" "" 

``CLUSTERS_DEFAULT``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). These are the default clusters to which Slurm submits workflow tasks. If the ``CLUSTERS_HPSS`` or ``CLUSTERS_FCST`` (see below) are not specified, the task will be submitted to the default clusters indicated in this variable. If this value is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. 

``QUEUE_DEFAULT``: (Default: "")
   The default queue or QOS to which workflow tasks are submitted (QOS is Slurm's term for queue; it stands for "Quality of Service"). If the task's ``QUEUE_HPSS`` or ``QUEUE_FCST`` variables (see below) are not specified, the task will be submitted to the queue indicated by this variable. If this value is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "batch" "dev" "normal" "regular" "workq" ""

``PARTITION_HPSS``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). Tasks that get or create links to external model files are submitted to the partition specified in this variable. These links are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) for the experiment. If this variable is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "normal" "service" "workq" ""

..
   COMMENT: Wouldn't it be reset to the PARTITION_DEFAULT value? 

``CLUSTERS_HPSS``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). Tasks that get or create links to external model files are submitted to the clusters specified in this variable. These links are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) for the experiment. If this variable is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. 

``QUEUE_HPSS``: (Default: "")
   Tasks that get or create links to external model files are submitted to this queue, or QOS (QOS is Slurm's term for queue; it stands for "Quality of Service"). If this value is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "batch" "dev_transfer" "normal" "regular" "workq" ""

``PARTITION_FCST``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). The task that runs forecasts is submitted to this partition. If this variable is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "hera" "normal" "orion" "sjet,vjet,kjet,xjet" "workq" ""

``CLUSTERS_FCST``: (Default: "")
   This variable is only used with the Slurm job scheduler (i.e., if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"). The task that runs forecasts is submitted to this cluster. If this variable is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. 

``QUEUE_FCST``: (Default: "")
   The task that runs a forecast is submitted to this queue, or QOS (QOS is Slurm's term for queue; it stands for "Quality of Service"). If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value. Valid values include: "batch" "dev" "normal" "regular" "workq"

Parameters for Running Without a Workflow Manager
=================================================
These settings control run commands for platforms without a workflow manager. Values will be ignored unless ``WORKFLOW_MANAGER="none"``.

``RUN_CMD_UTILS``: (Default: "mpirun -np 1")
   The run command for pre-processing utilities (shave, orog, sfc_climo_gen, etc.). This can be left blank for smaller domains, in which case the executables will run without MPI.

``RUN_CMD_FCST``: (Default: "mpirun -np \${PE_MEMBER01}")
   The run command for the model forecast step. This will be appended to the end of the variable definitions file ("var_defns.sh").

``RUN_CMD_POST``: (Default: "mpirun -np 1")
   The run command for post-processing (UPP). Can be left blank for smaller domains, in which case UPP will run without MPI.

Cron-Associated Parameters
==========================
``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH``: (Default: "FALSE")
   Flag that determines whether or not a line is added to the user's cron table that calls the experiment launch script every ``CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS`` minutes.

``CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS``: (Default: "03")
   The interval (in minutes) between successive calls of the experiment launch script by a cron job to (re)launch the experiment (so that the workflow for the experiment kicks off where it left off). This is used only if ``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH`` is set to "TRUE".

Directory Parameters
====================
``EXPT_BASEDIR``: (Default: "")
   The base directory in which the experiment directory will be created. If this is not specified or if it is set to an empty string, it will default to ``${HOMErrfs}/../../expt_dirs``, where ``${HOMErrfs}`` contains the full path to the ``regional_workflow`` directory.

``EXPT_SUBDIR``: (Default: "")
   The name that the experiment directory (without the full path) will have. The full path to the experiment directory, which will be contained in the variable ``EXPTDIR``, will be:

   .. code-block:: console

      EXPTDIR="${EXPT_BASEDIR}/${EXPT_SUBDIR}"

   This parameter cannot be left as a null string.

   .. code-block:: console

      $STMP/tmpnwprd/$RUN/$cdate

``NET, envir, RUN``:
   Variables used in forming the path to the directory that will contain the output files from the post-processor (UPP) for a given cycle (see definition of ``PTMP`` below). These are defined in the WCOSS Implementation Standards document as follows:

   ``NET``: (Default: "rrfs")
      Model name (first level of com directory structure)

For a cycle that starts on the date specified by YYYYMMDD and hour specified by HH (where YYYYMMDD and HH are as described above), the directory in which the UPP output files will be placed will be:
 
   .. code-block:: console

      $PTMP/com/$NET/$envir/$RUN.$yyyymmdd/$hh

Pre-Processing File Separator Parameters
========================================
``DOT_OR_USCORE``: (Default: "_")
   This variable sets the separator character(s) to use in the names of the grid, mosaic, and orography fixed files. Ideally, the same separator should be used in the names of these fixed files as the surface climatology fixed files.

This variable is not used if ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` is set to "FALSE".
 
``EXTRN_MDL_FILES_ICS``: (Default: "ICS_file1" "ICS_file2" "...")
   Array containing the names of the files to search for in the directory specified by ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS``. This variable is not used if ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` is set to "FALSE".

CCPP Parameter
==============
``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE``: (Default: "FV3_GFS_v15p2")
   The CCPP (Common Community Physics Package) physics suite to use for the forecast(s). The choice of physics suite determines the forecast model's namelist file, the diagnostics table file, the field table file, and the XML physics suite definition file that are staged in the experiment directory or the cycle directories under it. Current supported settings for this parameter are "FV3_GFS_v15p2" and "FV3_RRFS_v1alpha".
