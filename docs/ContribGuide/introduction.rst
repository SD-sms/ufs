## Background
------------------

### Authoritative branch

The `ufs-srweather-app` repository maintains a main branch for development called `develop`. The HEAD of `develop` reflects the latest development changes. It points to regularly updated hashes for individual subcomponents. Pull requests (PRs) will be merged to `develop`. 

The `develop` branch is protected by the code management team:
1. Pull requests for this branch require approval by at least two code reviewers.
1. A code manager should perform at least one of the reviews and the merge, but other contributors are welcome to provide comments/suggestions.


### Code Management Team

Scientists from multiple labs and organizations have volunteered to review pull requests for the `develop` branch:
